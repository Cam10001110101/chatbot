# AI Chatbot System

A sophisticated chatbot system that combines modern AI capabilities with an extensible tool architecture, built using Streamlit, LangChain, and LangGraph.

## Architecture Overview

The system is built around a graph-based workflow architecture that processes user messages through a series of nodes:

1. **Web Interface**: Streamlit-based frontend providing real-time chat interaction
2. **Workflow Engine**: LangGraph-powered message processing system
3. **AI Integration**: Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
4. **Tool System**: Extensible architecture for adding capabilities:
   - Tavily Search for web queries
   - DateTime for temporal awareness
5. **State Management**: Session-based state handling with memory persistence

The system uses a graph workflow where messages flow through nodes for processing, tool execution, and response generation. This architecture allows for easy extension and modification of the processing pipeline.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Use Python 3.8 or higher
   - Create and activate a virtual environment
   - Install dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Configure .env with required API keys

2. **Code Structure**
   - Main application in streamlit_app.py
   - Tools isolated in Tools directory
   - Configuration in config.yaml
   - Environment variables in .env

3. **Adding New Tools**
   - Create new tool file in Tools directory
   - Implement using LangChain tool specification
   - Add tool initialization to setup_graph()
   - Update system message with tool description

4. **Configuration Management**
   - AI model settings in config.yaml
   - Sensitive credentials in .env
   - Tool-specific settings in respective tool files

## Business Context

The system serves as a flexible chatbot platform that can be adapted for various use cases:

1. **Customer Service**: Handling user queries with AI and tool support
2. **Information Retrieval**: Combining AI with real-time web search
3. **Task Automation**: Extensible tool system for various operations
4. **Development Platform**: Base for building specialized AI applications

Success is measured through:
- Response accuracy and relevance
- Tool integration effectiveness
- System performance and reliability
- User satisfaction and engagement

## Quality Assurance

1. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for workflow
   - End-to-end tests for user scenarios
   - Performance testing for response times

2. **Code Quality**
   - Type hints throughout
   - PEP 8 compliance
   - Documentation requirements
   - Code review process

## Deployment and Operations

1. **Development Environment**
   - Local Streamlit server
   - Development-specific configuration
   - Tool API sandbox access

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Cloud platform hosting
   - Production API credentials
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Backup and recovery procedures

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - API version management
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security patches
